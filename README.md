# miRNA-Code
This project is the source code for identifying three prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers for human colorectal cancer. Certain miRNA expression files referenced in the code are too large to be uploaded to GitHub and will be available upon request (Contact at briansiyuanzheng@gmail.com)

**differentialexpressionanalysis.R**: The R code that was used in Limma to conduct differential expression analysis, requires a pre-built design and  expression matrix. 

**get_differentially_expressed_miRNAs.py**: Generates violin plots for miRNAs that are expressed at different levels between stages.

**linreg.py**: Linear Regression to Find miRNAs that are expressed at different levels across stages. 

**logisticregressioncode.py**: Code for Logistic Regression Classifier.
